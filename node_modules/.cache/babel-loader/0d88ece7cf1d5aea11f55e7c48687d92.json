The fruits mature within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp. The colour of the skin at maturity ranges from yellow-red depending on the variety. However, the optimum time of harvest depends on fruit quality and intended period of storage. Due to the introduction of dwarf rootstock hand picking is recommended as it reduces bruising due to fruit fall during mechanical harvesting.\"\n  },\n  banana: {\n    title: \"Bana Crop\",\n    imageUrl: bananaImage,\n    description: \"Banana is harvested when the fruit is slightly or fully mature depending on the market preferences. For long distance transportation, harvesting is done at 75-80 % maturity.  The fruit is climacteric and can reach consumption stage after ripening operation. The planted crop gets ready for harvest within 12-15 months of planting and the main harvesting season of banana is from September to April.  Bunches attain maturity from 90-150 days after flowering depending upon variety, soil, weather condition and elevation. Bunch should be harvested when fingers of second hand from top are 3/4 rounded with the help of sharp sickle 30cm above the first hand. Harvest may be delayed upto 100-110 days after opening of the first hand. Harvested bunch should generally be collected in well padded tray or basket and brought to collection site. Bunches should be kept out of light after harvest, since this hastens ripening and softening. For local consumption, hands are often left on stalks and sold to retailers.\"\n  },\n  blackgram: {\n    title: \"Blackgram Crop\",\n    imageUrl: blackgramImage,\n    description: \"Urd should be harvested when 70-80 % pods matured and most of the pods turn black.

This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.\"\n  },\n  cotton: {\n    title: \"Cotton Crop\",\n    imageUrl: cottonImage,\n    description: \"Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 60 to 120 cm (24 to 47 in)[citation needed]. Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn.\"\n  },\n  grapes: {\n    title: \"Grapes Crop\",\n    imageUrl: grapesImage,\n    description: \"Harvesting period for grapes, generally starts 30-70 days after fruit set, by the time berries change color from green to yellow (for white varieties), or red-purple (for red varieties). During this stage, we normally have an increase in sugars and a decrease in acids inside the fruits. In general, in the northern hemisphere, most varieties mature from August since November, while in the southern hemisphere from March to August.\"\n  },\n  jute: {\n    title: \"Jute Crop\",\n    imageUrl: juteImage,\n    description: \"To grow jute, farmers scatter the seeds on cultivated soil. When the plants are about 15–20 cm tall, they are thinned out. About four months after planting, harvesting begins. The plants are usually harvested after they flower, before the flowers go to seed. The stalks are cut off close to the ground. The stalks are tied into bundles and soaked in water for about 20 days. This process softens the tissues and breaks the hard [pectin] bond between the bast and [Jute hurd] (inner woody fiber stick) and the process permits the fibres to be separated. The fibres are then stripped from the stalks in long strands and washed in clear, running water.\"\n  },\n  kidneybeans: {\n    title: \"Kidney Beans Crop\",\n    imageUrl: kidneybeansImage,\n    description: \"Harvest when pods are full grown and ripe and there color turn to yellow.

The dried plants are used for haymaking. Maize grown for fodder are harvested at the milk to early dough stage. The earlier harvested crop usually yields less and is poor in protein content. For silage making late dough stage is preferred.\"\n  },\n  mango: {\n    title: \"Mango Crop\",\n    imageUrl: mangoImage,\n    description: \"In western India, mango puts forth three growth flushes, the first are in the early spring (FebruaryMarch), the second during March-April and the third in the beginning of winter (October-November). In Bihar, the first growth noticed in early spring, the second in April-May and the third in July-August. In UP, only two flushes are produced, in March-April and July-August. In Punjab, as many as five flushes are produced from April-August. April and Mayflushes being found most heavy. In South India, mango usually gives two growth flushes, one in February-June and the other in October-November. In mango about 8-10 months old shoots under certain conditions cease to grow at least 4 months prior to blossoming. These shoots are capable of producing flower buds. Other shoots, which appear in subsequent flushes during late monsoon, do not come to flowering. These shoots flower during the next season after accumulating sufficient metabolites necessary for fruit-bud differentiation. Thus the fruits will be ready for harvest in April-May from a plant flowered during October-November.\"\n  },\n  mothbeans: {\n    title: \"Mothbeans Crop\",\n    imageUrl: mothbeansImage,\n    description: \"The moth bean plants generally take between 75 and 90 days from planting to harvesting. Harvesting moth bean is pretty difficult, and it’s the main drawback to this crop. You have to cut the plants with a sickle, because you can’t use mowers mainly due to the shape and density of the moth bean’s branches. Then after cutting, it is threshed and winnowed after being dried for approximately one week.\"\n  },\n  mungbean: {\n    title: \"Mungbean Crop\",\n    imageUrl: mungbeanImage,\n    description: \"The olive-green mung beans should be harvested in the field after their pods have dried, typically in early to mid-September. Farmers use the same type of combine machinery used to harvest soybeans, but because mung beans are smaller than soybeans, they adjust the combine settings and screen size for the smaller bean size. Mung beans should be cleaned of debris before storage, and the beans should have no more than 12 percent moisture content for storage. Because harvested beans may be sprouted and eaten directly, stored beans should not be treated with fungicides, insecticides or bactericides.\"\n  },\n  muskmelon: {\n    title: \"Muskmelon Crop\",\n    imageUrl: muskmelonImage,\n    description: \"Many muskmelons and cantaloupes separate naturally from the stem when the melons are ripe, so they come away from the vine with only a gentle tug.

The ripening of fruits is associated with the change in colour, texture, quality and the development of the characteristic flavour. The fruits at the time of harvest should be uniform, firm and crisp. The colour of the skin at maturity ranges from yellow-red depending on the variety. However, the optimum time of harvest depends on fruit quality and intended period of storage.

Bunches attain maturity from 90-150 days after flowering depending upon variety, soil, weather condition and elevation. Bunch should be harvested when fingers of second hand from top are 3/4 rounded with the help of sharp sickle 30cm above the first hand. Harvest may be delayed upto 100-110 days after opening of the first hand. Harvested bunch should generally be collected in well padded tray or basket and brought to collection site. Bunches should be kept out of light after harvest, since this hastens ripening and softening.

In Punjab, as many as five flushes are produced from April-August. April and Mayflushes being found most heavy. In South India, mango usually gives two growth flushes, one in February-June and the other in October-November. In mango about 8-10 months old shoots under certain conditions cease to grow at least 4 months prior to blossoming. These shoots are capable of producing flower buds. Other shoots, which appear in subsequent flushes during late monsoon, do not come to flowering. These shoots flower during the next season after accumulating sufficient metabolites necessary for fruit-bud differentiation.

A lack of nitrogen causes the lower leaves to turn yellow and the whole plant to turn pale green.Phosphorous is needed for cell division and help form roots flowers and fruits.Phosphorous deficiency causes stunted growth and poor flowering and fruiting.Potassium is important for regulation of water and nutrient movement in plant cells, there by promoting fruiting ,flowering, hardiness and promote the overall health of the plant by providing resistance to diseases. A Potassium shortage show up in various ways but stun growth and yellowish lower leaves.Usage Instruction:seeds and seedling stage use 1/4 tsp to 1 liter water.After 3-4 true leaves stage use 1/2 tsp to 1 liter water . blooming stage use 2/3 tsp n-p-k to 1 liter water.\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"20-20\":{\r\n        title:\"20-20 Fertilizer\",\r\n        imageUrl:fert2020Image,\r\n        description:\"GROMOR 20-20-0-13 is Ammonium Phosphate Sulphate containing Nitrogen and Phosphate in 1:1 ratio.
